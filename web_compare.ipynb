    "Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that provide specific functionalities, making programming more efficient and reducing the need to write code from scratch. These libraries cover a wide range of applications, including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Some libraries, such as os, sys, math, json, and datetime, come built-in with Python as part of its standard library, providing essential functions for file handling, system operations, mathematical computations, and data serialization. Other popular third-party libraries, like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`, must be installed separately and are widely used in data science and machine learning. The extensive availability of libraries in Python's ecosystem makes it a versatile and powerful programming language for various domains. <br>\n",

    "`beautifulsoup4` is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides Pythonic methods for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree, making it ideal for web scraping tasks. BeautifulSoup is particularly useful for extracting data from web pages with inconsistent or poorly structured HTML. It works well with parsers like `html5lib` and `lxml`. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "`html5lib` is a pure-Python HTML parser designed to parse documents the same way modern web browsers do. It is especially useful for handling malformed or messy HTML. When used with `beautifulsoup4`, it provides robust parsing capabilities that help ensure accurate and tolerant extraction of web content. <br>\n",

    "`Matplotlib` is a widely used data visualization library that allows users to create static, animated, and interactive plots. It provides extensive tools for generating various chart types, including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts, making it a critical library for exploratory data analysis. <br>\n",
    "https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`notebook` is the Python package that powers the classic Jupyter Notebook interface. It provides a web-based environment for writing and running code in interactive cells, supporting rich media, visualizations, and markdown documentation. The notebook server manages the execution of kernels and renders notebooks in a browser. This tool is foundational for data analysis, teaching, and exploratory programming workflows. <br>\n",
    "https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient support for numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions such as mean, median, and standard deviation. It is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and engineering.\n",
